## Description

Web application built with React and TailwindCSS that allows users to enchant items and view a real-time leaderboard. The project uses Firestore for the backend and supports Google and anonymous authentication. All users can enchant items, but only Google-authenticated users can save their items to the leaderboard. The real-time leaderboard updates instantly to display the top enchanted items.
